## Payment methods

There are a lot of providers on the market. Which one do I choose? What are the decision criteria?

- Does the customer need the possibility for credit card payments?
- Who takes care of the contracts with payment providers?
- Do they need additional features such as automated credit checks?
- Are there regional/country-specific restrictions?
- What are the pricing structures?
- Can one provider cover multiple payment methods (e.g. credit cards &amp; LSV &amp; debit cards) or should a different provider be chosen per payment method?
- Who are my customers? For example, is it common to pay by credit card or LSV in the USA?
