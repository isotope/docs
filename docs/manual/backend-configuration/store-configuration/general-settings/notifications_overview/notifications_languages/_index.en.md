{{% notice warning %}}
This article is machine translated.
{{% /notice %}}

`Sprachen` are, as mentioned in earlier chapters, not necessarily present in every gateway or notification type. For human recipients of messages, however, they are logically of great importance and the `Benachrichtigungszentrum` allows you some settings.

{{% notice info %}}
This chapter makes repeated reference to [Simple Tokens](/de/simple-tokens/). In the notification center, an autocomplete function has been added to simplify the use of these very tokens. By tapping "##" you get a selection of the available Simple Tokens as [well as a](/de/simple-tokens/) description of them.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
The following settings refer to the gateway "E-Mail". Other gateways may have different settings (e.g. most likely neither "CC address fields" nor "BCC address fields").
